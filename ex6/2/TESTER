Hey!

unzip the tester, then copy wave_editor.py file to the folder.

It is important!! Write the name of the first function in your
code in the appropriate row in the Tester.

The test requires the mock package. You can install from the pip or through the pyCharm.

after it, run through pytest

Good luck!
